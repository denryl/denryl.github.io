  <p class="w3-justify"><b>Self-Help for Anxiety Management (SAM) anxiety app</b></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Developed by scientists in the U.K., SAM is an unusual app because it encourages users to think about situations that make them anxious and how they would think and act in each scenario. “What we see in anxiety disorders often is that people get trapped in this avoidance cycle where they avoid the things that make them anxious and therefore don’t master the skills to cope,” Dr. Schueller says. “One of the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders are exposure-based treatments, so things that actually get us to face our fears.”</p>
